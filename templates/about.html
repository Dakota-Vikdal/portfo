                  <h3>A bit about me</h3>
                  <p>Hello Viewer, thanks for stopping by to check out my portfolio. Although it isn't vast, I certainly put my heart into it.
                    So, about me. I am a software developer who graduated from Flatiron in May of 2023 as a full stack developer. After school I pursued 
                    Python primarily, with React/Javascript sprinkled in every once in a while. Over the past few months I have found myself falling in love
                    with programming. I have found myself being pulled to it even during times when I should be resting. It has, in some sense, become a part of my time of rest.
                  </p>
                  <h3>
                    A bit about my past
                  </h3>
                  <p>As for how my past contributes to my skillset; I have a background in education, holistic healthcare, horticulture, and customer service.
                    As someone who has taught both as a head instructor and an assitant instructor, I understand what it is like to be a beginner as well advanced within a subject matter.
                    I know the necessity of asking questions and remaining humble when approaching a new subject. I try to bring these qualities of curiousity and egolessness into my software engineering
                    journey; I believe doing so helps drastically in the learning endearvor. As for my experience within holistic healthcare; it is always useful to know 
                    how to take care of yourself and to understand that within life there must always be a balance, otherwise the mind and body will become compromised. As for horticulture, I just think plants are awesome.
                    Lastly, customer service, being in this field developed my 'soft skills' which are incredibly important when it comes to enjoying the workplace and the company of those around you.
                    Simply knowing how to enjoy a converstion with someone, or perhaps being aware of body language and vocal fluctuations and behaving accordingly, these are important skills to learn and hone.
                  </p>

                  <p>I would like to delve deeper into web development. I am intrigued to see where this path of tech will take me. For now, I would like to get into web development, both on the front end as well as the back end.</p>
